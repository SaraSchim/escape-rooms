React + Node.js

This is a real business of my family that has so far been conducted by phone orders and word of mouth advertising.

The site I built is planned to go online later, create broad advertising and provide a more effective content response.

I tried to make the site as friendly as possible - from anywhere you can easily return to the home page or any other page.

At the bottom of the site there is a question asking form. The form can be filled out and the details sent to the business email address.

The site is connected to a database on the mongoDB site, reads the data from it and updates it with every order and change.

### Instructions for running the site:

Open a terminal in the client folder and a terminal in the server folder at the same time

• Installation of the modules:

In each terminal individually run "npm install"

• Running the site:

In the client terminal run npm start

In the server terminal run npm run dev
